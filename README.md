# Description
Atto — _**A**nother **T**ool for **T**racking & **O**ptimizing (Applications)_ — is an open-source, AI-powered command center built for job seekers who are tired of managing their careers in messy spreadsheets. It automates the "boring" parts of job hunting — parsing descriptions, tracking application progress, and customizing your resume — so you can focus on winning the interview.

# Features
- **Local-First & Private**: Your job search is your business. Atto runs locally, keeping your data on your machine. We do not collect or save any data.
- **Smart Scraper**: Paste a job URL, and Atto automatically extracts job titles, companies, and requirements into a clean, structured format for you to review before saving.
- **Centralized Job List**: View all your saved listings in one place, organized for easy management.
- **Progress Tracking**: Simple status updates to keep track of where each application stands in your pipeline.

# Roadmap
Atto is in early development. Here is what we're working on next:

- **AI Match Scoring**: Automatically analyze how well a role fits your specific profile to help you prioritize your time.
- **Discovery Agent**: Give Atto a keyword, and it will autonomously find new listings across Greenhouse, Lever, and LinkedIn.
- **Automated Follow-ups**: AI-generated email drafts for following up on applications where you haven't heard back.
- **Enhanced Status Management**: A revamped system for more detailed tracking and automated funnel movements.
- **Visual Analytics**: Charts and heatmaps to track your application volume and success rates.
- **Multi-Provider AI Support**: Add support for different AI models including Google Gemini and local-first providers like Ollama for 100% offline privacy and no API costs.

# Installation
See the [setup and installation guide](setup.md).

# Supporting the Project
Atto is an early-stage demo, and I’m building it in the open to help fellow job seekers. If you find it helpful, there are a few ways you can support the development:

1. **Star the Repo**: It helps others find the project and keeps me motivated to keep building.
2. **Share Your Feedback**: Found a bug or have a feature idea? Open an issue or reach out via [Google Forms](https://forms.gle/b5DMrQZ6XMZTBXjYA).
3. **Spread the Word**: Share Atto with your network. The more people use it, the better it gets for everyone.

Built with ❤️ by Austin. Cheers!
